When looking at the emergence of DevOps, new ways of interacting between parties involved in
software development triggered a need for new ways of IT management. This resulted in DevOps.
Which parties that found new ways to interact are meant?
A) Business and customers
B) IT departments and customers
C) IT Development and Operations
A) Incorrect. The business itself may have changed ways of interacting with their customers, but this did
not trigger DevOps per se. DevOps was triggered by the interaction between the IT department and the
business (customer).
B) Correct. "First, due to the emergence of new ways of interacting with the business customers, and to
the adequate application of Agile development techniques, a need for new ways of IT management
has developed." New ways are required to interact with customers as per the changes in the market
and in the way people relate with their preferred brands, also adequate application of Agile techniques
implies a better perceived return on Agile by the business (not just IT). (Literature: A, Chapter 1.1.3)
C) Incorrect. The interaction between internal IT areas is not what triggered the development of DevOps.

DevOps relies heavily on the principles and practices of Lean Production. One of the types of waste
in IT is 'task switching'.
From which original type of waste is this the translation for IT?
A) Motion
B) Overproduction
C) Transportation
D) Waiting
A) Incorrect. Handoffs in IT corresponds to motion in Lean.
B) Incorrect. Extra feature in IT corresponds to overproduction in Lean.
C) Correct. Task switching in IT corresponds to transportation in Lean. (Literature: A, Chapter 2.1.1)

The most valuable information of a value stream map is taken from three key metrics.
What is one of these three key metrics?
A) Lead time combined with flow
B) Percentage complete and accurate
C) Process time divided by lead time
D) Value completed minus waste
A) Incorrect. Lead time is a key metric, but flow is not a metric. It is a concept of velocity that can be
measured by lead time and process time.
B) Correct. Percent complete and accurate is a key metric of the value stream map that helps to gather
the most valuable information. (Literature: A, Chapter 3.1)
C) Incorrect. Process time and lead time are both key metrics, but the ratio between them is not a useful
measure.
D) Incorrect. Value completed minus waste is not a metric. Both are DevOps concepts, though.

When switching to DevOps, a greater return on information technology is expected.
What differentiates DevOps from Agile, Scrum and Lean to meet this expectation?
A) DevOps accelerates the delivery of new and modified products between Dev and Ops.
B) DevOps accelerates the delivery of new and modified products to the market and customers.
C) DevOps ensures a quicker response to changes in the infrastructure within budget.
D) DevOps ensures a quicker response to incidents that hinder the organization’s value stream.
A) Incorrect. Accelerating the delivery of products between departments is a consequence of DevOps.
However, since it does not deliver value to the customer, it is not an expected value from DevOps to
achieve greater return on IT.
B) Correct. This is how DevOps will produce greater return on IT; by accelerating the delivery of products
to customers in production, helping the business realize value faster and better. (Literature: A, Chapter
1.2)
C) Incorrect. Changes to the infrastructure are an internal need from IT, also adherence to budget. The
business will not get greater returns on IT just from changing the infrastructure.
D) Incorrect. This is not a way to achieve greater return on IT. Even though quicker responses will
produce a better user experience, it does not help to produce greater returns on its own.

A company wants to reduce their time-to-market from years to months. One of their coworkers
says they should consider using DevOps methods in the IT department.
Why would changing to DevOps help reduce their time-to-market?
A) Because DevOps integrates Development and Operations into a single team, there are fewer people
employed.
B) Because DevOps teams are more expensive, they work more overtime and get a product on the
market quicker.
C) Because DevOps uses self-sufficient dedicated teams, there is more agility to deal with changing
product requirements.
A) Incorrect. There are usually not fewer, but more people employed, because each product or product
line has their own dedicated self-sufficient team of developers, operators and other specialists. In
addition, the integration itself does not make DevOps a faster way of developing necessarily, but
makes software more robust when deployed, because Dev understands the needs of Ops better.
B) Incorrect. Although the self-sufficient dedicated teams can be more expensive, DevOps practices
never rely on structurally working overtime to get things done faster. Quite the opposite is true:
DevOps likes to try to find a sustainable pace and rhythm.
C) Correct. Because there is a single dedicated and self-sufficient team working on a single product,
there are less distractions and interruptions to the work on that product. In addition, the team does
not need to wait for a specialist. This reduces great amounts of waste in the form of waiting time and
helps the team reduce their time-to-market. (Literature: A, Chapter 1.3.1)

What are two common practices for reducing technical debt?
A) Formal change and release management practices
B) Incident management and request fulfilment practices
C) Increasing budget and resources
D) Refactoring and facing the issue
A) Incorrect. These are two processes that could increase technical debt.
B) Incorrect. These two processes could cause technical debt instead of reducing it.
C) Incorrect. This will not directly help reduce technical debt, although when there are more developers,
technical debt may be reduced faster.
D) Correct. According to the literature, two of the commonly used practices are Refactoring and facing
the issue. (Literature: A, Chapter 1.3)

Which significant advantage does DevOps bring to an organization?
A) Eliminate fragility of a business system
B) Lower costs for the customer
C) Reduce cultural challenges
A) Correct. "DevOps is expected to address: reducing time to market, reducing technical debt and
eliminating fragility." (Literature: A, Chapter 1.3.3)
B) Incorrect. DevOps practices can be more expensive and there is no focus on reducing the costs for
the customer.
C) Incorrect. Although DevOps encourages a diverse team, this does not guarantee a reduction of
cultural challenges.

Sometimes, it is thought that DevOps is a part of Agile.
To which question, that has nothing to do with Agile, does DevOps give an answer?
A) What can be done to release the software we develop quick enough to take a large market share?
B) What relationship with our customers is necessary, so that we understand their requirements better?
C) What should be done with a released product to make it useful and easy to operate?
A) Incorrect. The release of a product is both part of Agile and DevOps. Agile helps to quickly release
functioning parts of the final product. DevOps further explores ways of delivering real value to actual
customers better.
B) Incorrect. The relationship with the customer and the requirement gathering are both part of Agile and
DevOps. Product Owners will maintain close contact with the customer to ensure value is being added
to the product.
C) Correct. Thinking about the release and operate phases during development are not necessarily part
of Agile, but they are an essential part of DevOps. (Literature: A, Chapter 1.5.1)

Why is the concept 'value stream' so important in DevOps?
A) The value stream helps coworkers to see and understand their daily tasks.
B) The value stream helps to analyze the as-is map and any attempts to improve metrics.
C) The value stream helps to identify when someone did their part of the work.
D) The value stream helps to realize a smooth and uniform flow through all process steps.
E) The value stream helps to realize local optimization in the current work practice.
A) Incorrect. This is the 'what' of their work, while missing the expected outcome: the 'why'.
B) Incorrect. The optimization work should not be limited to analyzing the as-is map. It is necessary to
develop a to-be map, which may be quite different from the current work practice.
C) Incorrect. It is important to know when the customer received or started to receive the value they
expected.
D) Correct. The concept of the value stream ensures that a smooth and uniform flow from one step to
the next in the process can be created. (Literature: A, Chapter 3.1)
E) Incorrect. It helps to identify and eliminate bottlenecks, while avoiding the local optimization trap.


/ 80
What is the first step in value stream mapping?
A) Create the requirements specification
B) Document the work done
C) Identify the key steps in the process
A) Incorrect. The first step should be to identify key steps for the team’s particular process and
organization.
B) Incorrect. Documentation of the work done should be done only after identifying the key steps. Work
done on non-essential steps is not part of the value stream map.
C) Correct. This should be the first step when value stream mapping. The organization should look at the
process for which they want to create a value stream map and identify the key steps where work is
done and value is added. (Literature: A, Chapter 3.1)

A value stream map shows clearly where the inefficiencies in a value stream are.
Why should a value stream map be made?
A) To help optimize business processes
B) To see which people are not working hard enough
C) To speed up the work in progress (WIP)
D) To visualize which product line should be ended
A) Correct. This is the reason one should have in mind when creating the value stream map and this is
where the exercise has the most value. (Literature: A, Chapter 3.1)
B) Incorrect. The reason to do a value stream mapping is not to see who is redundant, who should get
fired first or who is not pulling their weight. Instead, the processes should be optimized, so that the
people in the company can start producing higher quantities with higher quality.
C) Incorrect. Although the process may speed up, the work itself does not necessarily need to speed up.
Rather, the work itself may slow down to avoid errors and increase first-time-right, which can save a
step of quality control. Speeding up the work is not the goal, eliminating waste and adding more value
to the business is.
D) Incorrect. Although the business may decide to end a business line or a product line based on the
value stream map, this is never the goal of value stream mapping. Instead, value stream mapping
should only be done for viable products.

Tasks need to be prioritized. This prioritization takes place in the queue at the entry of the value
stream.
Why does this prioritization often cause problems?
A) Because at this point, the decision is made how to build the deployment pipeline for the tasks that can
be automated. This takes time, which causes delays.
B) Because enabling measurements of the key indicators in the value stream is done incorrectly or
inefficiently, which leads to problems.
C) Because implementation of the use of visualization tools along with work-in-progress limits (WIP-
limits), with which one can identify the bottlenecks of the tasks, is done incorrectly.
D) Because the development of the as-is version and the to-be version of the stream must be created, as
well as a list of the changes required. This takes a lot of time.
E) Because when many decisions are made before work even starts, like in the traditional approach, this
causes massive delays.
A) Incorrect. This step is taken later in the process and does not cause problems at the queue at the
entry of the value stream.
B) Incorrect. This is not an objective of the first step of the value stream (maximization of the number of
metrics) and should not be done at this point, so this should not cause the problems mentioned.
C) Incorrect. In this way a state of an even flow without delays is achieved and bottlenecks are shown,
but this is not the problem that occurs at the point mentioned.
D) Incorrect. This is achieved later in the process of the value stream, so this should not cause problems
at the point mentioned.
E) Correct. When an organization keeps using many traditional practices, where all decisions regarding
the work are made before starting the work, this causes the problems mentioned. (Literature: A,
Chapter 4.10)

Which idea is the origin of the concept 'deployment pipeline'?
A) A pipeline that carries a liquid creating flow
B) An assembly line such as a car plant
C) Modern processors that use parallel pipelining
D) The idea of using more than one assembly line
E) The process of deploying people to do different jobs
A) Incorrect. This is a common inaccurate opinion and not the proper meaning of the concept.
B) Incorrect. This is a common inaccurate opinion and not the proper meaning of the concept.
C) Correct. Humble and Farley clarified that when they coined the term they used the idea of pipelining
from modern processors architecture that allows it to produce far faster results. (Literature: A,

When implementing the deployment pipeline, problems are encountered. Initially, there are not
enough pre-developed tests to ensure steady operation of the Production environment.
Which solution best addresses this problem?
A) Create the pipeline and as many automations as possible, but do not use them until all the proper
tests are in place.
B) Increase the coverage of the code with tests as technical debt, which must be addressed as soon as
possible.
C) Let the pipeline run with the developed tests and deal with the potential issues in Production when
they arise.
D) Use the pipeline as an integration system to deliver the written code to test and quality assurance
(QA) only.
A) Incorrect. Creating the pipeline and not using it until all the tests are in place will take too much time,
which loses the business money. An iterative approach should be attempted, with the most important
tests first and continuously generating new tests to increase coverage.
B) Correct. Increasing the coverage of the code with tests is the only solution for this problem.
(Literature: A, Chapter 3.2)
C) Incorrect. Letting the pipeline run with a small set of tests creates poor testing coverage and
potentially creates many issues in production. This hinders the adoption of the pipeline.
D) Incorrect. The deployment pipeline aims to deliver working code to Production, not just to test and QA,
so it will not fit its purpose.

A good version control system is one of the highest predictors of high performance in DevOps.
What is necessary to apply version control successfully?
A) A change in the culture of working with information and configuration
B) A significant increase in the speed of change implementation
C) The deliberate introduction of chaos and instability in Production
D) The use of a formalized and automated change management process
A) Correct. Versioning allows for control over all the relevant parts of the system in operation,
unattainable with other tools. Version control done well requires a change in the culture of working
with information and configuration. (Literature: A, Chapter 3.3)
B) Incorrect. The degree of automation has increased significantly in the last years due to the use of
virtual cloud technologies, and so has the speed of the change implementation, but that is not a
required principle for version control.
C) Incorrect. One of the great practices of DevOps related to anti-fragility is the deliberate introduction of
chaos and instability into the production environment. This technique is known by various names:
game day, chaos monkey, simian army. None of these are required principles for version control.
D) Incorrect. To deal with fragility in the IT infrastructure, some organizations use formalized and
automated change management processes designed to structure the flow of changes and minimize
the risks associated with their implementation, but that is not a required principle for version control.

For DevOps, finding the balance between moving quickly and maintaining application reliability is
important.
How does version control support this?
A) By allowing any member of the team to freely delete unnecessary files and documents
B) By allowing the formation of small independent and self-sufficient development teams
C) By applying specialized tools to eliminate or reduce waste and optimize processes
A) Correct. Version control allows any member of the team to freely delete unnecessary files and
documents, without the risk of accidental loss of important information or product. (Literature: A,
Chapter 3.3)
B) Incorrect. Forming small, self-sufficient and diverse teams is a key idea in DevOps, but it is not the
way version control supports agility and reliability of the system.
C) Incorrect. This is a practical application of Lean production ideas to IT. Use specialized tools to
identify waste; then apply other specialized tools to eliminate or reduce waste. However, this is not
the way version control supports agility and reliability of the system.

What benefit does configuration management have?
A) It allows any team member to delete unwanted files without risk.
B) It allows key team members to be absent without problems.
C) It allows team members to see who changed which code at what date.
A) Incorrect. It is version control that allows any team member to freely delete information. If anything
goes wrong, the previous version can be restored.
B) Correct. When all changes are controlled by configuration management, the system is automatically
restored to a previous stable state if necessary. In addition, if key team members leave, their
knowledge is not lost, but solidified in the configuration. (Literature: A, Chapter 3.4)
C) Incorrect. The records of what was changed when and by whom are part of version control and not of
configuration management.

Configuration management makes it possible to scale IT infrastructure and software systems,
without needing more people working on them.
How should changes to such a scaled environment ideally be done?
A) Through continuous integration
B) Through fully controlled scripts
C) Through test automation
D) Through the deployment pipeline
A) Incorrect. Continuous Integration is the second stage in implementing a deployment pipeline, but not
the only way administrators should be allowed to change anything in production. Ideally this is all
done by automated scripts.
B) Correct. In fact, it can be argued that even administrators no longer should have rights in production.
They should not be allowed to change anything except through fully controlled (and automated)
scripts. (Literature: A, Chapter 3.3, 3.4)
C) Incorrect. Test automation is the third stage in implementing a deployment pipeline, but not the only
way administrators should be allowed to change anything in production. Ideally this is all done by
automated scripts.
D) Incorrect. At an abstract level, a well-working and fully automated deployment pipeline is an
automated manifestation of the process for getting software from version control into the hands of
users. However, a manual deployment pipeline is possible. It is not a description of the way
administrators should be allowed to change anything in production. Ideally this is all done by
automated scripts.

A clear definition of done is (DoD) critical in DevOps and considers the value for the customer.
What is a good description of 'done' for DevOps?
A) A requirement is done when it has been built.
B) A requirement is done when it has been tested.
C) A requirement is done when the product is accepted.
D) A requirement is done when the product is in Production.
A) Incorrect. Something is considered 'done' when value for the customer has been added. Building is
just a phase in the DevOps pipeline, no added value is obtained yet.
B) Incorrect. Something is considered 'done' when value for the customer has been added. Testing is just
a phase in the DevOps pipeline, no added value is obtained yet.
C) Incorrect. Something is considered 'done' when value for the customer has been added. Acceptance
is just a phase in the DevOps pipeline, no added value is obtained yet.
D) Correct. Something is considered 'done' when value for the customer has been added. This is true
when the product is in the production environment. (Literature: A, Chapter 3.5)

In traditional practices many things can go wrong with releases: some changes are not
documented, the system has not been backed up fully, or there is no previous state of the system
saved.
How does DevOps ensure frequent releases without these problems?
A) By automating releases
B) By letting Operations release
C) By making releases very small
D) By not documenting all changes
A) Correct. Automation is an important factor in ensuring that releases are frequent and that the release
process becomes routine. If all human factors of backing up, documenting and rolling back are
automated, the chances of problems with releasing diminish dramatically. If a release cannot be
implemented successfully, the system will alert the team to act. (Literature: A, Chapter 4.1)
B) Incorrect. Giving Operations control does not prevent the mentioned problems. Looking at Operations
and integrating Development into their practices may shed light on which parts of the release process
need automating and standardization. Just handing over releasing to Operations will not solve the
problems mentioned.
C) Incorrect. The size of the release does not matter as much as the automation to make the routine
releases work. The smaller releases will not necessarily prevent any of the problems mentioned.
Releasing frequently will make the releases smaller.
D) Incorrect. This will make the problems worse. Introducing a versioning system, preferably automated,
will help eliminate the problems caused by improper documentation.

A company uses continuous deployment.
Whose decision should it be when to release new functionality?
A) The business
B) The customer
C) The IT department
D) The user
A) Correct. Releasing new functionality to be used becomes a business decision when using continuous
deployment. The functionality may already have been deployed for a time before the business decides
that it is time to switch the functionality on. The IT department releases in their own tempo, the
business decides when to release new functionality. (Literature: A, Chapter 4.1)
B) Incorrect. Although this stakeholder is important for the decision, releases are primary a business
decision.
C) Incorrect. Although this stakeholder is important for the decision, releases are primary a business
decision.

According to DevOps practices, what is the best way to increase the level of operational control?
A) Automating all manual operations
B) Defining appropriate roles and responsibilities
C) Designing control procedures
D) Improving operational governance
A) Correct. Automating as many operations as possible will give total control, because all operations
become instant and uniform. When an operation is suboptimal, changing the automation will also
change all future operations. (Literature: A, Chapter 4.1.3)
B) Incorrect. Although defining roles and responsibilities is important, it does not directly impact the
control over all operations.
C) Incorrect. Just designing procedures will not help. Once the procedures are designed, they should be
automated so no errors are made, and all operations are uniform.
D) Incorrect. Although this may be desirable anyway, just governing does not give more control.
Automation ensures total control.

What is the DevOps way of solving incidents?
A) Escalate to the problem management team and create a solution until they solve the incident
B) Investigate the incident, run diagnostics, then identify and implement a workaround
C) See if a related incident occurred earlier and implement a similar solution to the problem
D) Trace the incident back to a recent deployment and roll the system back to a previous stable state
A) Incorrect. This solution may lead to a working workaround, in which case the real problem may never
get solved.
B) Incorrect. Implementing a workaround does not solve the incident. This is not how one should
operate.
C) Incorrect. The solution is most likely a workaround, which is not desirable. One should not wait until
someone else fixes the problem.
D) Correct. According to the literature, "In case the incident is traced back to a recent deployment, the
pipeline control system will automatically roll back to the previous known stable state". This is what
should happen, whether this process is automated or still done manually. (Literature: A, Chapter 4.1)

In DevOps, what should be done when process deficiencies are found?
A) All changes should be submitted to a backlog, so they can be released in a project or a Kaizen event.
B) Fixes should be found and implemented as soon as possible after detection of the deficiency.
C) Fixes should be found, approved by the change manager, and released based on priority.
D) Fixes should be found, approved by the continuous improvement manager, and released immediately.
E) Fixes should be postponed until the change can be included in an appropriate iteration.
A) Incorrect. A large change event or a Kaizen event may be useful, but regular changes to the process
as a part of continuous improvement should be done as quickly as possible.
B) Correct. Not fixing process deficiencies when they have been detected leads to more problems than
necessary. "Therefore, DevOps uses a different approach: all identified process deficiencies should be
eliminated immediately." (Literature: A, Chapter 4.1)
C) Incorrect. There is no change manager and the fixes should be implemented immediately.
D) Incorrect. There is no continuous improvement manager to approve any fixes.

What does not help a DevOps team to successfully develop and deliver working software?
A) Forming a DevOps team for a short period of time during a project
B) Identifying, fixing and learning from errors as soon as they are found
C) Organizing DevOps teams around an organizational mission
D) Writing code for software to have built-in quality as a main goal
A) Correct. DevOps teams are formed for a longer period. This gives them the opportunity to use their
experience in the future to deliver new software quicker and to keep innovating. (Literature: A, Chapter
4.2)
B) Incorrect. When batches are smaller, errors can be found more easily and corrected immediately.
DevOps focuses on the Lean process of finding errors fast, fixing them in the process immediately
and optimizing the process.
C) Incorrect. One of DevOps’s main advantages is that the team adds value to the business by aligning
their work to a specific organizational goal.
D) Incorrect. Focusing on built-in quality is a Lean property incorporated by DevOps. When one is coding
for quality, it may take longer, but because fewer bugs are found and the system is built to be more
robust, this adds value in the end.

Which two goals can be realized by visualization?
Please remember to choose 2 answers.
A) Building a pull-system
B) Dividing the work
C) Fostering commitment
D) Identifying inefficiencies
E) Informing the customer
A) Correct. This is a benefit of using visualization. Visualizing allows to build a pull system, which in turn:
improves the workflow; reduces downtime; reduces the need for coordination. Visualization also helps
to identify inefficiencies. (Literature: A, Chapter 4.3)
B) Incorrect. A team can effectively divide the work without visualization. Commitment is not fostered by
visualization, although it is important for DevOps to be successful. The person acting as Voice of the
Customer or Voice of the Business should update the customer.
C) Incorrect. A team can effectively divide the work without visualization. Commitment is not fostered by

A) The team does not have to improve the process anymore.
B) The team uses their experience to innovate and improve the process.
C) The team will start working more independently.
D) There is time left to process unexpected requests more often.
A) Incorrect. DevOps teams are always looking to improve. That is what continuous improvement is for.

C) Incorrect. Working together does not mean that the team works more independently. They have the
organizational mission to adhere to for direction. Other than that, they should be self-sufficient from
the start.
D) Incorrect. A batch is planned with backlog items according to their priority. Processing many
unexpected requests should never be a goal in DevOps. The requests should go in the backlog and be

A) Correct. Finding ways to eliminate the cause of the bottlenecks should be done as fast as possible.
When the bottleneck is eliminated, the work could even get done in the iteration it was promised,
although this is not common. (Literature: A, Chapter 4.11)
B) Incorrect. In this case, that is not the best way of dealing with the problem. Scrum allows occasional
extensions of the iteration length. However, in DevOps there is even more focus on establishing
rhythm than in Scrum. Therefore, one should only extend the iteration as a last resort.
C) Incorrect. Limiting the batch size helps to identify the problems causing the bottlenecks. It should be
implemented as part of DevOps practices, though. It should not only be implemented after the team
has identified a bottleneck.
D) Incorrect. This helps to identify bottlenecks, but it should not be implemented after the team has
identified a bottleneck.

When can the use of DevOps for organizational and technological changes lead to chaos and loss
of control?
A) When the core business of the organization highly depends on IT
B) When the organization is complex and wants to solve chronic problems
C) When the organization requires rapid changes to test new business ideas
D) When the rate of change in the IT used by the organization is high
A) Incorrect. Organizations (should) become interested in DevOps when the core business is highly
dependent on information technology.
B) Correct. For complex situations, DevOps most likely will not bring much profit and will definitely give
no quick wins. Chronic problems should be solved carefully, thoughtfully and judiciously. One should
not just hope that DevOps is a magical cure for all problems. (Literature: A, Chapter 5.1)
C) Incorrect. Organizations (should) become interested in DevOps when the main business requires rapid
changes to test new business ideas or hypotheses.
D) Incorrect. Organizations (should) become interested in DevOps when the rate of change occurring in
the IT used, is high.

There are many reasons for a company to become interested in DevOps.
When should companies become interested in DevOps?
A) When Agile practices do not seem to fit the company
B) When no other method gives the necessary results
C) When Scrum and Lean practices have been implemented
A) Incorrect. This should be a trigger to seriously reconsider DevOps practices for a company. When
Agile practices do not seem to be relevant to a company, there is no harm in looking into DevOps
practices. However, since DevOps practices include many Agile concepts, DevOps may not be for that
company.
B) Correct. Companies (should) become interested in DevOps when all other tried-and-tested methods of
increasing effectiveness no longer give significant results. Even though this is not the best reason to
start using DevOps practices, DevOps should definitely be investigated when nothing else works.
(Literature: A, Chapter 5.1)
C) Incorrect. There is no need to wait until Scrum and Lean practices are implemented to start DevOps
practices. In fact, many of the DevOps practices will rely on Scrum and Lean concepts. They should
work with each other seamlessly. DevOps allows the company to choose whatever works best in that
company.

What can cause difficulties when DevOps is adopted?
A) Cross-functional teams
B) Limited use of virtualization
C) Microservice architecture
A) Incorrect. DevOps teams are cross-functional; having cross-functional teams gives organizations a
head start in DevOps.
B) Correct. Organizations using little virtualization will have difficulties implementing DevOps practices.

An IT system is still being developed and maintained by many employees as a single entity.
What difficulty with adopting DevOps practices can be expected?
A) Assigning DevOps teams to separate areas of responsibility
B) Creating cross-functional teams to work on the organizational structure
C) Maintaining and versioning multiple APIs for backward compatibility
A) Correct. A significant obstacle for the implementation of DevOps practices is a monolithic, rigidly
bound IT architecture. Introduction of small teams requires the ability to assign a separate area of
responsibility to each of them. In a situation where the IT system in question is still being developed
and maintained by dozens or hundreds of employees as a single entity, it will be difficult to separate
parts for individual independent teams that work asynchronously. (Literature: A, Chapter 5.1)
B) Incorrect. There is no inhibition in the creation of cross-functional teams themselves.
C) Incorrect. With a monolithic application, developers must only chnage the class name and API. With
microservices, developers must change the version number of the API and maintain multiple APIs for
backward compatibility. In this case, no microservices have been implemented yet, so this is not an
expected problem. In addition, although it may require a system for versioning, this is not a problem,
but progress and an expected result and ultimately benefit of implementing DevOps practices.

Commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) is used to quickly get the results needed, because it
takes time to develop custom software.
What is true about COTS?
A) COTS requires customization and scripting to configure the system.
B) COTS should be used to support strategic business lines.
C) Using ready to use software is generally more flexible.
D) Using ready to use software is usually much cheaper.
A) Correct. With scripting it is possible to configure this kind of software. However, there might be
limitations and configuring the system still takes time. (Literature: A, Chapter 5.2)
B) Incorrect. Off-the-shelf software will not automatically support strategic business lines. Scripting will
be necessary to make that possible (if it is possible at all). It is recommended not to use COTS for
strategic business lines.
C) Incorrect. Commercial off-the-shelf software is always limiting flexibility. It is not always possible to
configure it the way the team wants or needs to.
D) Incorrect. Configuring such software will take time, which means extra effort and extra expenses. In
addition, the value the business actually needs may not be delivered.

What is a difficulty of a rigid or monolithic IT architecture?
A) Changing and developing the IT architecture itself is difficult to do
B) Modifying services within the architecture is done independently
C) Updating to a new version without disabling the current version
D) Waiting for all components to be ready for a large-scale migration
A) Correct. This is a problem of a rigid IT architecture. The larger and more rigid the architecture, the
more difficult it becomes to change anything, whilst still seeing what that change does to the rest of
the architecture. (Literature: A, Chapter 5.3)
B) Incorrect. This is a solution of the problem. When all services can be modified independently, the
architecture is no longer rigid.
C) Incorrect. This can be a challenge even when the architecture is not rigid.
D) Incorrect. It is not necessarily rigid when a large-scale migration is done and all components should
be made ready for that. This could happen in any type of IT architecture.

It is recommended that organizations customize and select DevOps practices that work in that
organization. Organization-specific questions must be raised and organization-specific answers
must be found.
Why is this a good idea?
A) Because DevOps publications do not always reflect reality and underreport difficulties and failures.
B) Because that is the way to become a DevOps engineer that can be hired for implementing DevOps.
C) Because the management teams know best how to implement DevOps in their own organization.
D) Because there are too few publications and events about DevOps to form independent opinions.
A) Correct. The overwhelming amount of literature does not necessarily prepare the team for all
struggles and failures reality may pose. It is important to filter your information and see what applies
to the organization’s situation most. (Literature: A, Chapter 5.6)
B) Incorrect. DevOps cannot be implemented and there is no engineer that can be hired to bring the new
order to IT.
C) Incorrect. There is no such thing as implementing DevOps.

An organization has a legacy IT infrastructure. They want to start with DevOps.
What is a common approach in such an organization?
A) To start implementing DevOps as a software product, install it and start it
B) To start with a basic pipeline that performs at least assembly and initial testing
C) To start with a selection of the product with the greatest opportunities for optimization
D) To start with identifying those systems that are loosely connected with others
E) To start with the allocation of a certain proportion of working time for the improvement
A) Incorrect. DevOps is not a software product that can be installed and started.
B) Incorrect. This is not an approach to start with DevOps. This is required to proceed with the building of
the deployment pipeline for the part of the stream that can be automated.
C) Incorrect. This is the start of developing the value stream mapping.

A clear Definition of Done is critical in DevOps and considers the value for the customer.
What is a good description of Done for DevOps?
A) A requirement is Done when it has been built.
B) A requirement is Done when it has been tested.
C) A requirement is Done when the product is accepted.
D) A requirement is Done when the product is in Production.
A) Incorrect. A good description of Done for DevOps is to consider something Done when value for the
customer has been added. Build is just a phase in the DevOps pipeline, no added value is obtained yet.
B) Incorrect. A good description of Done for DevOps is to consider something Done when value for the
customer has been added. Testing is just a phase in the DevOps pipeline, no added value is obtained

Tasks need to be prioritized. This prioritization takes place in the queue at the entry of the value
stream.
Why does this prioritization often cause problems?
A) Because at this point, the decision is made how to build the deployment pipeline for the tasks that can
be automated. This takes time, which causes delays.
B) Because enabling measurements of the key indicators in the value stream is done incorrectly or
inefficiently, which leads to problems.
C) Because implementation of the use of visualization tools along with WiP-limits with which one can
identify the bottlenecks of the tasks is done incorrectly.
D) Because the development of the as-is version and the to-be version of the stream must be created, as
well as a list of the changes required. This takes a lot of time.
E) Because when the traditional approach is still used, it requires many decisions to be made before
work even starts, which causes massive delays.
A) Incorrect. This step is taken later in the process and does not cause problems at the queue at the
entry of the value stream.
B) Incorrect. This is not an objective of the first step of the value stream (maximization of the number of
metrics) and should not be done at this point, so this should not cause the problems mentioned.
C) Incorrect. In this way a state of an even flow without delays is achieved and bottlenecks are shown,
but this is not the problem that occurs at the point mentioned.
D) Incorrect. This is achieved later in the process of the value stream, so this should not cause problems
at the point mentioned.
E) Correct. When an organization keeps using many traditional practices, where all decisions regarding
the work are made before starting the work, this causes the problems mentioned. (Literature: A 4.10)

Why is the concept 'value stream' so important in DevOps?
A) The value stream helps employees to see and understand their daily tasks.
B) The value stream helps to analyze the as-is map and any attempts to improve metrics.
C) The value stream helps to identify when someone did their part of the work.
D) The value stream helps to realize a smooth and uniform flow through all process steps.
E) The value stream helps to realize local optimization in the current work practice.
A) Incorrect. This is "The what of their work", while missing the expected outcome "The why".
B) Incorrect. The optimization work should not be limited to analyzing the as-is map. It is necessary to
develop a to-be map, which may be quite different from the current work practice.
C) Incorrect. It is important to know when the customer received or started to receive the value they
expected.
D) Correct. The concept of the value stream ensures that a smooth and uniform flow from one step to
the next in the process can be created. (Literature: A 3.1)
E) Incorrect. It helps to identify and eliminate bottlenecks, while avoiding the local optimization trap.

E) The process of deploying people to do different jobs
A) Incorrect. This is a common inaccurate opinion and not the proper meaning of the concept.
B) Incorrect. This is a common inaccurate opinion and not the proper meaning of the concept.
C) Correct. Humble and Farley clarified that when they coined the term they used the idea of pipelining
from modern processors architecture that allows it to produce far faster results. (Literature: A 3.2)

For DevOps, finding the balance between moving quickly and maintaining application reliability is
important.
How does version control support this?
A) By allowing any member of the team to freely delete unnecessary files and documents
B) By allowing the formation of small independent and self-sufficient development teams
C) By applying specialized tools to eliminate or reduce waste and optimize processes
Sample Exam EXIN DevOps Foundation (DEVOPSF.EN) 17
A) Correct. Version control allows any member of the team to freely delete unnecessary files and
documents, without the risk of accidental loss of important information or product. (Literature: A 3.3)
B) Incorrect. Forming small, self-sufficient and diverse teams is a key idea in DevOps, but it is not the
way version control supports agility and reliability of the system.
C) Incorrect. This is a practical application of Lean Production ideas to IT. Use specialized tools to
identify waste; then apply other specialized tools to eliminate or reduce waste. However, this is not the
way version control supports agility and reliability of the system.

In DevOps, what should be done when process deficiencies are found?
A) All changes should be submitted to a backlog, so they can be released in a project or a Kaizen event.
B) Fixes must be found and implemented as soon as possible after detection of the deficiency.
C) Fixes must be found, approved by the change manager, and released based on priority.
D) Fixes must be found, approved by the continuous improvement manager, and released immediately.
E) Fixes should be postponed until the change can be included in an appropriate sprint.
A) Incorrect. A large change event or a Kaizen event may be useful, but regular changes to the process
as a part of continuous improvement should be done as quickly as possible.
B) Correct. Not fixing process deficiencies when they have been detected leads to more problems than
necessary. As the literature states that "DevOps uses a different approach: all identified process
deficiencies should be eliminated immediately." (Literature: A 4.1)
C) Incorrect. There is no change manager and the fixes should be implemented immediately.
D) Incorrect. There is no continuous improvement manager to approve any fixes.
E) Incorrect. Postponing is not a great idea. It keeps the system inefficient and impacts the work
negatively.

A value stream map shows clearly where the inefficiencies in a value stream are.
Why should a value stream map be made?
A) To help optimize business processes
B) To see which people are not working hard enough
C) To speed up the Work-in-Progress (WiP)
D) To visualize which product line should be ended
A) Correct. This is the reason one should have in mind when creating the value stream map and this is
where the exercise has the most value. (Literature: A 3.1)
B) Incorrect. The reason to do a value stream mapping is not to see who is redundant, who should get
fired first or who is not pulling their weight. Instead, the processes should be optimized, so that the
people in the company can start producing higher quantities with higher quality.
C) Incorrect. Although the process may speed up, the work itself does not necessarily need to speed up.
Rather, the work itself may slow down to avoid errors and increase first-time-right, which can save a
step of quality control. Speeding up the work is not the goal, eliminating waste and adding more value
to the business is.
D) Incorrect. Although the business may decide to end a business line or a product line based on the
value stream map, this is never the goal of value stream mapping. Instead, value stream mapping
should only be done for viable products.

A) The team does not have to improve the process anymore.
B) The team uses their experience to innovate and improve the process.
C) The team will start working more independently.
D) There is time left to process unexpected requests more often.
A) Incorrect. DevOps teams are always looking to improve. That is what continuous improvement is for.
A team that works together for longer may even feel more confident changing routines and improving
processes.
B) Correct. DevOps teams that work together longer have the opportunity to use their experience in
future development and to deliver more quickly and innovate the processes. (Literature: A 4.9)
C) Incorrect. Working together does not mean that the team works more independently. They have the
organizational mission to adhere to for direction. Other than that, they should be self-sufficient from
the start.
D) Incorrect. A batch is planned with backlog items according to their priority. Processing many
unexpected requests should never be a goal in DevOps. The requests should go in the backlog and be
prioritized. Only then should they be taken up in the next iteration.

B) Through fully controlled scripts
C) Through test automation
D) Through the deployment pipeline
A) Incorrect. Continuous Integration is the second stage in implementing a deployment pipeline, but not
the only way administrators should be allowed to change anything in Production. Ideally this is all
done by automated scripts.
B) Correct. In fact, it can be argued that even administrators no longer should have rights in Production.

A company wants to reduce their time-to-market from years to months. One of their employees
says they should consider using DevOps methods in the IT department.
Why would changing to DevOps help reduce their time-to-market?
A) Because DevOps integrates Development and Operations into a single team, there are fewer people
employed.
B) Because DevOps teams are more expensive, they work more overtime and get a product on the
market quicker.
C) Because DevOps uses self-sufficient dedicated teams, there is more agility to deal with changing
product requirements.
A) Incorrect. There are usually not fewer, but probably more people employed, because each product or
product line has their own dedicated self-sufficient team of developers, operators and other
specialists. In addition, the integration itself does not make DevOps a faster way of developing
necessarily, but makes software more robust when deployed, because Dev understands the needs of
Ops better.
B) Incorrect. Although the self-sufficient dedicated teams can be more expensive, DevOps practices
never rely on structurally working overtime to get things done faster. Quite the opposite is true:
DevOps likes to try to find a sustainable pace and rhythm.
C) Correct. Because there is a single dedicated and self-sufficient team working on a single product,
there are less distractions and interruptions to the work on that product. In addition, the team does not
need to wait for a specialist. This reduces great amounts of waste in the form of waiting time and
helps the team reduce their time-to-market. (Literature: A 1.3.1)

What does not help a DevOps team to successfully develop and deliver working software?
A) Forming a DevOps team for a short period of time during a project
B) Identifying, fixing and learning from errors as soon as they are found
C) Organizing DevOps teams around an organizational mission
D) Writing code for software to have built-in quality as a main goal
A) Correct. DevOps teams are formed for a longer period. This gives them the opportunity to use their
experience in the future to deliver new software quicker and to keep innovating. (Literature: A 4.2)
B) Incorrect. When batches are smaller, errors can be found more easily and corrected immediately.
DevOps focuses on the Lean process of finding errors fast, fixing them in the process immediately
and optimizing the process.
C) Incorrect. One of DevOps’s main advantages is that the team adds value to the business by aligning
their work to a specific organizational goal.
D) Incorrect. Focusing on built-in quality is a Lean property incorporated by DevOps. When one is coding
for quality, it may take longer, but because fewer bugs are found and the system is built to be more
robust, this adds value in the end.

What is one of these three key metrics?
A) Lead time combined with flow
B) Percentage complete and accurate
C) Process time divided by lead time
D) Value completed minus waste
A) Incorrect. Lead time is a key metric, but flow is not a metric. It is a concept of velocity that can be
measured by lead time and process time.
B) Correct. Percent complete and accurate is a key metric of the value stream map that helps to gather
the most valuable information. (Literature: A 3.1)

A good version control system is one of the highest predictors of high performance in DevOps.
What is necessary to apply version control successfully?
A) A change in the culture of working with information and configuration
B) A significant increase in the speed of change implementation
C) The deliberate introduction of chaos and instability in Production
D) The use of a formalized and automated change management process
A) Correct. Versioning allows for control over all the relevant parts of the system in operation,
unattainable with other tools. Version control done well requires a change in the culture of working
with information and configuration. (Literature: A 3.3)
B) Incorrect. The degree of automation has increased significantly in the last years due to the use of
virtual cloud technologies, and so has the speed of the change implementation, but that is not a
required principle for version control.
C) Incorrect. One of the great practices of DevOps related to anti-fragility is the deliberate introduction of
chaos and instability into the Production environment. This technique is known by various names:
Game Day, Chaos Monkey, Simian Army. None of these are required principles for version control.
D) Incorrect. To deal with fragility in the IT infrastructure, some organizations use formalized and
automated change management processes designed to structure the flow of changes and minimize
the risks associated with their implementation, but that is not a required principle for version control.

A) Incorrect. Organizations (should) become interested in DevOps when the core business is highly
dependent on information technology.
B) Correct. For complex situations, DevOps most likely will not bring much profit and will definitely give
no quick wins. Chronic problems should be solved carefully, thoughtfully and judiciously. One should
not just hope that DevOps is a magical cure for all problems. (Literature: A 5.1)
C) Incorrect. Organizations (should) become interested in DevOps when the main business requires rapid
changes to test new business ideas or hypotheses.
D) Incorrect. Organizations (should) become interested in DevOps when the rate of change occurring in
the information technology used, is high.

When looking at the emergence of DevOps, new ways of interacting between parties involved in
software development triggered a need for new ways of IT management. This resulted in DevOps.
Which parties that found new ways to interact are meant?
A) Business and customers
B) IT departments and customers
C) IT development and operations
A) Incorrect. The business itself may have changed ways of interacting with their customers, but this did
not trigger DevOps per se. DevOps was triggered by the interaction between the IT department and the
business (customer).
B) Correct. "First, due to the emergence of new ways of interacting with the business customers, and to
the adequate application of Agile development techniques, a need for new ways of IT management
has developed." New ways are required to interact with customers as per the changes in the market
and in the way people relate with their preferred brands, also adequate application of Agile techniques
implies a better perceived return on Agile by the business (not just IT). (Literature: A 1.1.3)
C) Incorrect. The interaction between internal IT areas is not what triggered the development of DevOps.

What can cause difficulties when DevOps is adopted?
A) Cross-functional teams
B) Limited use of virtualization
C) Microservice architecture
A) Incorrect. DevOps teams are cross-functional; having cross-functional teams gives organizations a
head start in DevOps.
B) Correct. Organizations using little virtualization will have difficulties implementing DevOps. (Literature:
A 5.1)
C) Incorrect. Microservice architecture emerged from a common set of DevOps ideologies gives
organizations a head start in DevOps.

According to DevOps practices, what is the best way to increase the level of operational control?
A) Automating all manual operations
B) Defining appropriate roles and responsibilities
C) Designing control procedures
D) Improving operational governance
A) Correct. Automating as many operations as possible will give total control, because all operations
become instant and uniform. When an operation is suboptimal, changing the automation will also
change all future operations. (Literature: A 4.1.3)
B) Incorrect. Although defining roles and responsibilities is important, it does not directly impact the
control over all operations.
C) Incorrect. Just designing procedures will not help. Once the procedures are designed, they should be
automated so no errors are made, and all operations are uniform.
D) Incorrect. Although this may be desirable anyway, just governing does not give more control.
Automation ensures total control.

When switching to DevOps, a greater return on information technology is expected.
What differentiates DevOps from Agile, Scrum and Lean to meet this expectation?
A) DevOps accelerates the delivery of new and modified products between Dev and Ops.
B) DevOps accelerates the delivery of new and modified products to the market and customers.
C) DevOps ensures a quicker response to changes in the infrastructure within budget.
D) DevOps ensures a quicker response to incidents that hinder the organization’s value stream.
A) Incorrect. Accelerating the delivery of products between departments is a consequence of DevOps.
However, since it does not deliver value to the customer, it is not an expected value from DevOps to
achieve greater return on IT.
B) Correct. This is how DevOps will produce greater return on IT; by accelerating the delivery of products
to customers in Production, helping the business realize value faster and better. (Literature: A 1.2)
C) Incorrect. Changes to the infrastructure are an internal need from IT, also adherence to budget. The
business will not get greater returns on IT just from changing the infrastructure.
D) Incorrect. This is not a way to achieve greater return on IT. Even though quicker responses will
produce a better user experience, it does not help to produce greater returns on its own.

An organization has a legacy IT infrastructure. They want to start with DevOps.
What is a common approach in such an organization?
A) To start implementing DevOps as a software product: install it and start it
B) To start with a basic pipeline that performs at least assembly and initial testing
C) To start with a selection of the product with the greatest opportunities for optimization
D) To start with identifying those systems that are loosely connected with others
E) To start with the allocation of a certain proportion of working time for the improvement
A) Incorrect. DevOps is not a software product that can be installed and started.
B) Incorrect. This is not an approach to start with DevOps. This is required to proceed with the building of
the deployment pipeline for the part of the stream that can be automated.
C) Incorrect. This is the start of developing the value stream mapping.
D) Correct. DevOps can start anywhere, wherever the business is now. Identifying loosely connected
systems is the first step. (Literature: A 5.6)
E) Incorrect. This relates to the technical debt.

An IT system is still being developed and maintained by many employees as a single entity.
What difficulty with adopting DevOps practices can be expected?
A) Assigning DevOps teams to separate areas of responsibility
B) Creating cross-functional teams to work on the organizational structure
C) Maintaining and versioning multiple APIs for backward compatibility
A) Correct. A significant obstacle for the implementation of DevOps is a monolithic, rigidly bound IT
architecture. Introduction of small teams requires the ability to assign a separate area of
responsibility to each of them. In a situation where the IT system in question is still being developed
and maintained by dozens or hundreds of employees as a single entity, it will be difficult to separate
parts for individual independent teams that work asynchronously. (Literature: A 5.1)
B) Incorrect. There is no inhibition in the creation of cross-functional teams themselves.
C) Incorrect. With a monolithic application, developers only must change the class name and API. With
microservices, developers must change the version number of the API and maintain multiple APIs for
backward compatibility. In this case, no microservices have been implemented yet, so this is not an
expected problem. In addition, although it may require a system for versioning, this is not a problem,
but progress and an expected result and ultimately benefit of implementing DevOps practices.

What is the DevOps way of solving incidents?
A) Escalate to the problem management team and create a solution until they solve the incident
B) Investigate the incident, run diagnostics, then identify and implement a workaround
C) See if a related incident occurred earlier and implement a similar solution to the problem
D) Trace the incident back to a recent deployment and roll the system back to a previous stable state
A) Incorrect. This solution may lead to a working workaround, in which case the real problem may never
get solved.
B) Incorrect. Implementing a workaround does not solve the incident. This is not how one should
operate.
C) Incorrect. The solution is most likely a workaround, which is not desirable. One should not wait until
someone else fixes the problem.
D) Correct. According to the literature, "In case the incident is traced back to a recent deployment, the
pipeline control system will automatically roll back to the previous known stable state". This is what
should happen, whether this process is automated or still done manually. (Literature: A 4.1)

DevOps recommends visualization of the work done.
Which two goals can be realized by visualization?
Please remember to choose 2 answers.
A) Building a pull-system
B) Dividing the work
C) Fostering commitment
D) Identifying inefficiencies
E) Informing the customer
A) Correct. Building a pull-system is a benefit of using visualization. Visualizing allows to build a pull
system, which in turn: improves the workflow; reduces downtime; reduces the need for coordination.
Visualization also helps to identify inefficiencies. (Literature: A 4.3)
B) Incorrect. A team can effectively divide the work without visualization.
C) Incorrect. Commitment is not fostered by visualization, although it is important for DevOps to be
successful.
D) Correct. Visualization also helps to identify inefficiencies. (Literature: A 4.3)
E) Incorrect. The person acting as Voice of the Customer or Voice of the Business should update the
customer.

A company uses continuous deployment.
Whose decision should it be when to release new functionality?
A) The business
B) The customer
C) The IT department
D) The user
A) Correct. Releasing new functionality to be used becomes a business decision when using continuous
deployment. The functionality may already have been deployed for a time before the business decides
that it is time to switch the functionality on. The IT department releases in their own tempo, the
business decides when to release new functionality. (Literature: A 4.1)
B) Incorrect. Although this stakeholder is important for the decision, releases are primary a business
decision.
C) Incorrect. Although this stakeholder is important for the decision, releases are primary a business
decision.
D) Incorrect. Although this stakeholder is important for the decision, releases are primary a business
decision.

What are two common practices for reducing technical debt?
A) Formal change and release management practices
B) Incident management and request fulfilment practices
C) Increasing budget and resources
D) Refactoring and facing the issue
A) Incorrect. These are two processes that could cause technical debt. Moreover, it can be argued that
some well-known practices offered by ITIL, when applied inexpertly or in isolation, can also lead to
growth of technical debt.
B) Incorrect. These are two processes that could cause technical debt. Moreover, it can be argued that
some well-known practices offered by ITIL, when applied inexpertly or in isolation, can also lead to
growth of technical debt.
C) Incorrect. This will not directly help reduce technical debt, although when there are more developers,
technical debt may be reduced faster.
D) Correct. According to the literature, two of the commonly used practices are Refactoring and facing
the issue. (Literature: A 1.3)

When implementing the deployment pipeline, problems are encountered. Initially, there are not
enough pre-developed tests to ensure steady operation of the Production environment.
Which solution best addresses this problem?
A) Create the pipeline and as many automations as possible, but do not use them until all the proper
tests are in place.
B) Increase the coverage of the code with tests as technical debt, which must be addressed as soon as
possible.
C) Let the pipeline run with the developed tests and deal with the potential issues in Production when
they arise.
D) Use the pipeline as an integration system to deliver the written code to test and quality assurance
(QA) only.
A) Incorrect. Creating the pipeline and not using it until all the tests are in place will take too much time,
which loses the business money. An iterative approach should be attempted, with the most important
tests firsts and continuously generating new tests to increase coverage.
B) Correct. Increasing the coverage of the code with tests is the only solution for this problem.
(Literature: A 3.2)
C) Incorrect. Letting the pipeline run with a small set of tests creates poor testing coverage and
potentially creates many issues in Production. This hinders the adoption of the pipeline and impacts
the business and the DevOps promise to the organization.
D) Incorrect. The deployment pipeline aims to deliver working code to Production, not just to test and QA,
so it will not fit its purpose, nor will it help DevOps to improve what Agile already delivers.

In traditional practices many things can go wrong with releases: some changes are not
documented, the system has not been backed up fully, or there is no previous state of the system
saved.
How does DevOps ensure frequent releases without these problems?
A) By automating releases
B) By letting Operations release
C) By making releases very small
D) By not documenting all changes
A) Correct. Automation is an important factor in ensuring that releases are frequent and that the release
process becomes routine. If all human factors of backing up, documenting and rolling back are
automated, the chances of problems with releasing diminish dramatically. If a release cannot be
implemented successfully, the system will alert the team to act. (Literature: A 4.1)
B) Incorrect. Giving Operations control does not prevent the mentioned problems. Looking at Operations
and integrating Development into their practices may shed light on which parts of the release process
need automating and standardization. Just handing over releasing to Operations will not solve the
problems mentioned.
C) Incorrect. The size of the release does not matter as much as the automation to make the routine
releases work. The smaller releases will not necessarily prevent any of the problems mentioned.
Releasing frequently will make the releases smaller.
D) Incorrect. This will make the problems worse. Introducing a versioning system, preferably automated,
will help eliminate the problems caused by improper documentation.

What is the first step in value stream mapping?
A) Create the requirements specification
B) Document the work done
C) Identify the key steps in the process
A) Incorrect. This is the first key step in the process of the example value stream map in the literature. It
is not the first step in value stream mapping in general. Not all value stream maps will include a
requirements specification. This entirely depends on the processes and organization for which the
value stream map is created. The first step should be to identify key steps for your particular process
and organization.
B) Incorrect. Documentation of the work done should be done only after identifying the key steps. Work
done on non-essential steps is not part of the value stream map.
C) Correct. This should be the first step when value stream mapping. The organization should look at the
process for which they want to create a value stream map and identify the key steps where work is
done and value is added. (Literature: A 3.1)

What is a difficulty of a rigid or monolithic IT architecture?
A) Changing and developing the IT architecture itself is difficult to do
B) Modifying services within the architecture is done independently
C) Updating to a new version without disabling the current version
D) Waiting for all components to be ready for a large-scale migration
A) Correct. This is a problem of a rigid IT architecture. The larger and more rigid the architecture, the
more difficult it becomes to change anything, whilst still seeing what that change does to the rest of
the architecture. (Literature: A 5.3)
B) Incorrect. This is a solution of the problem. When all services can be modified independently, the
architecture is no longer rigid.
C) Incorrect. This can be a challenge even when the architecture is not rigid.
D) Incorrect. It is not necessarily rigid when a large-scale migration is done and all components should
be made ready for that. This could happen in any type of IT architecture.

The team works in one-week iterations and frequently encounters bottlenecks.
What is the best reaction of the team after they identify a bottleneck?
A) Eliminate the bottleneck as soon as possible
B) Lengthen the iteration in which a bottleneck is found
C) Limit the regular number of tasks in a batch
D) Use visualization tools along with WiP-limits
A) Correct. Finding ways to eliminate the cause of the bottlenecks should be done as fast as possible.
When the bottleneck is eliminated, the work could even get done in the iteration it was promised,
although this is not common. The Product Owner can prioritize work for the current iteration.
(Literature: A 4.11)
B) Incorrect. In this case, that is not the best way of dealing with the problem. Scrum allows occasional
extensions of the iteration length. However, in DevOps there is even more focus on establishing
rhythm than in Scrum. Therefore, one should only extend the iteration as a last resort.
C) Incorrect. Limiting the batch size helps to identify the problems causing the bottlenecks. It should be
implemented as part of DevOps practices, though. It should not only be implemented after the team
has identified a bottleneck.
D) Incorrect. This helps to identify bottlenecks, but it should not be implemented after the team has
identified a bottleneck.

Sometimes, it is thought that DevOps is a part of Agile.
To which question does DevOps give an answer, that has nothing to do with Agile?
A) What can be done to release the software we develop quick enough to take a large market share?
B) What relationship with our customers is necessary, so that we understand their requirements better?
C) What should be done with a released product to make it useful and easy to operate?
A) Incorrect. The release of a product is both part of Agile and DevOps. Agile helps to quickly release
functioning parts of the final product. DevOps further explores ways of delivering real value to actual
customers better.
B) Incorrect. The relationship with the customer and the requirement gathering are both part of Agile and
DevOps. Product Owners will maintain close contact with the customer to ensure value is being added
to the product.
C) Correct. Thinking about the release and operate phases during development are not necessarily part
of Agile, but they are an essential part of DevOps. (Literature: A 1.5.1)

What benefit does configuration management have?
A) It allows any team member to delete unwanted files without risk.
B) It allows key team members to be absent without problems.
C) It allows team members to see who changed which code at what date.
A) Incorrect. It is version management that allows any team member to freely delete information. If
anything goes wrong, the previous version can be restored.
B) Correct. When all changes are controlled by configuration management, the system is automatically
restored to a previous stable state if necessary. In addition, if key team members leave, their
knowledge is not lost, but solidified in the configuration. (Literature: A 3.4)
C) Incorrect. The records of what was changed when and by whom are part of version control and not of
configuration management.
